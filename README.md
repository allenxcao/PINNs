This repository comprises my comprehension and implementation of the paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125. As illustrative examples, we begin by implementing the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to approximate a provided polynomial function. Subsequently, we employ the PINN to solve the Poisson equation; and then Burgers equation, which is utilized to address an inverse problem in this presentation.
